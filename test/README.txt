This folder contains data to be used as test data for SSR Finder. Instructions for use are included in the manual. Note that the simulated genome used to generate the false positive rates table is too large to upload here so the output of the 'exportFPRTable' runmode is included here as 'testClouds_hg38_chr22_AAG_AATC_sim_FPR'.
